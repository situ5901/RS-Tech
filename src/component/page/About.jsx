          <h3>Our Story</h3>
          <p style={{ fontSize: "14px" }}>
            Founded in 2024 by founder Shivansh (Situ), RS-Tech was born out of a desire to solve complex problems with simple and efficient technology solutions. We started from scratch with no employees and limited financial resources. This means we need to be creative, resourceful, and strategic in our approach to building our company.

            Some potential strategies we’ve considered:
            <ul>
              <li>Leverage freelance or contract workers to augment our skills and capacity.</li>
              <li>Focus on low-cost, high-impact marketing and sales strategies, such as social media, content marketing, and networking.</li>
              <li>Develop strategic partnerships with other businesses or organizations to access new markets, expertise, or resources.</li>
              <li>Prioritize services and focus on a specific niche or industry to differentiate ourselves and build a strong reputation.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
